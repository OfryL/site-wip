## MCP Server Configuration

### Core MCP Servers
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browsermcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["browsermcp"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-filesystem", "/Users/ofri/repos/temp-site"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "uvx", 
      "args": ["mcp-server-git", "--repository", "/Users/ofri/repos/temp-site"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "postgres": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-postgres"],
      "env": {
        "POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING": "postgresql://localhost/temp_site_dev"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Optional MCP Servers (Enable as needed)
- **SQLite**: Local database operations
- **Redis**: Caching and session management  
- **MongoDB**: Document database operations
- **AWS**: Cloud services integration
- **Docker**: Container management
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration and deployment

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Standards
- Automated code review by `@code-reviewer`
- Security analysis by `@security-specialist` 
- Performance validation by `@performance-optimizer`
- Documentation updates by `@documentation-specialist`

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Performance tests for scalability validation

### Git Workflow
- Feature branch development
- Pull request reviews with agent assistance
- Automated quality checks via git hooks
- Commit message standardization

## Agent Coordination Rules

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
1. `@orchestrator` coordinates complex multi-step tasks
2. `@vibe-coding-coordinator` prepares development environment
3. Specialized agents handle domain-specific tasks
4. `@task-checker` validates all outputs before completion

### Quality Gates
- Code must pass security review
- All tests must pass
- Documentation must be updated
- Performance benchmarks must be met

### Error Handling
- Automatic rollback on critical failures
- Error escalation to appropriate specialists
- Learning from failures to improve future performance

## Project-Specific Configuration

### Environment Setup
